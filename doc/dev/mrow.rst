Actions with mrow
=================

In this section we will describe how ``mrow`` elements will handle DOM events.

Mouse over and out
------------------

When the pointing device is moved onto an ``mo`` the element should change its
color (default to blue).

When the pointing device is moved away from an ``mo`` it should change its
color to back.

This behavior can be achieve changing the color value attribute.
