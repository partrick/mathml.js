Welcome to MathML.js's documentation!
=====================================

"MathML is a low-level specification for describing mathematics as a basis for
machine to machine communication which provides a much needed foundation for the
inclusion of mathematical expressions in Web pages." (From
http://www.w3.org/Math/)

MathML.js is a Javascript library to enable GRAPHIC humam manipulation of MathML
elements. This work is based on

* `DragMath <http://www.dragmath.bham.ac.uk/index.html>`_,
* `TouchOfMath <https://github.com/jlabarbera11/TouchOfMath>`_ and
* `Equation Exercise Demo (proof of concept)
  <http://galvosukykla.lt/failai/coding/equation-exercise/proof-of-concept.html>`_.

MathML.js ISN'T:

* a jquery-like Javascript library for MathML (try `jquery-mathml
  <https://github.com/sdiehl/jquery-mathml>`_);
* a math Javascript library (try `Math.js <http://mathjs.org/>`_);
* a Symbolic Math Javascript Library (try `Symbolic-Math-Library-for-Javascript
  <https://github.com/jamesmclellan/Symbolic-Math-Library-for-Javascript>`_).
